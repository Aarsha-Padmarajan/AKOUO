# AKOUO

AKOUO ("to hear") aims to enhance communication between the deaf community and hearing individuals by translating spoken English to sign language in real time with the use of animated avatars. This innovative solution seeks to improve inclusivity and streamline communication with the use of sophisticated speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP) and animation technologies.

  Then each word is mapped to a gif, and the gifs are shown in a sequence, one-after-another.
